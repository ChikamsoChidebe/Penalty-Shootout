# ⚽ Penalty Shootout Duel - Somnia v1 Mini-Games Hackathon

**🏆 Somnia's First On-Chain Sports Mini-Game**

A fully on-chain, fast-paced penalty shootout betting game built for the Somnia Testnet. Experience the thrill of penalty shootouts with cryptographic fairness, instant settlements, and real-time gameplay - all powered by Somnia's 1M+ TPS capability.

## ✨ What Makes It Special

- **Fully On-Chain**: All game logic, randomness, and state management on Somnia EVM
- **Fair & Fast**: Commit-reveal scheme ensures fairness in under 60 seconds
